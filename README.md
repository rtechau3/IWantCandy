# IWantCandy
Data visualization about the feelings different candies evoke, using D3



Possible cutoffs for feelings coloring:
- averages would need to be truncated to one decimal place

1.0-1.6 Despair (blue)
1.7-2.3 Meh (Green)
2.4-3.0 Joy (Yellow)

Averages can be found at STATEdata[candy index here][3]
Candy indices go from 2-end in order that they exist in the CSV
